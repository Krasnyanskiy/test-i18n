# i18n app

A simple demo app which demonstrates how to use [i18n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization) in your Spring Web application. It shows you two ways of using i18n:

* Static internationalization (page content: titles, text)
* Dynamic internationalization (messages from db, services, etc)
